# A complete starter template for ASGI Web apps
## Features:
- Full development setting complete with docker image
- Bocadillo back-end (python) ASGI framework
- Vue front end
- Sass styles
- Webpack pre-configured with babel (Issue with bocadillo not serving directly out of webpack folder in production / workaround in place move webpack/webpack files into just webpack then delete the second webpack folder)

## Plans for future:
- Setup docker swarm and integrate db
- Fix really bad docs (sorry if your reading this was in a hurry)
